# mars-rover-app

This is an excercise from DevSkill.

The react.js app was created with vite and typescript.

In this excercise I tried to give a twist. Due to the explendid conditions I needed to store all the data from the API in the app and that is why no async await, nor .then was implied.

when running "npm install" if some dependencies are not installed please run the command again but with --legacy-peer-deps -->" npm install --legacy-peer-deps".

The topics implemented are:

- i18next
- useState
- useEffect
- useReducer
- Redux
- unit test and coverage with jest and react-testing-library
- e2e test with Cypress

in the package.json we can see the usefull commands:

- npm run dev --> runs the app.
- npm run test --> run all the tests.
- npm run coverage --> create the coverage info and also we can use the ---> coverage/lcov-report/index.html as a nice way to see the coverage in the navigator.
- npm run cypress --> for triggering the Cypress e2e interface, you can choose desired navigator

for doing on the future or not test i18next related behavior:
- test RenderPhoto component.
- test Speech component.

... some easter eggs around
